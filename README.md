                                                         THE BIG TRUCK   

This app was created to provide an effective yet functional
method to help trucking companies find their next load and 
for brokers and shippers to quickly get on track to having
their freight hauled.

It provides users with a simple search feature based on their
role in the transportation process to quickly and easily 
access our database, which is always overflowing with drivers
and loads.

It also allows users to add drivers and loads to the database.

Javascript, jQuery, HTML and CSS was used to code the frontend. 
This code can be found in: app.js, and all .html/.css files.
The backend is comprised of MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express 
framwork for this Node.js application. The Big Truck was created  
using Express framework for this Node.js application. Data through 
this app is handled through MongoDB. Its data structure is
relatively simple and can be easily manipulated using the Mongoose 
library. Testing is done with the help of Mocha and Chai/chai-http.
The Big Truck is completely intergrated with Travis CI and is 
continualy monitored for continuous integration and continuous
development. Code containing those frameworks and libraries will be found
in: server.js, models.js, seedData.js, config.js, and test.js.

Other developers can use this app to structure a database that
is comprised of two tables with their desired fields and perform
CRUD operations on them. They also have an example of functioning 
deployments to Heroku and CI/CD through Travis CI.
